Welcome to my portfolio repository!

This repository contains a selection of my work and projects that showcase my skills and experience as a developer.

In the root directory, you will find a brief overview of my background and a list of technologies that I have experience with. The projects directory contains a detailed list of my past and current projects, each with its own subdirectory. Each project directory includes a description of the project, a list of technologies used, and links to live demos or code repositories.

I hope you find my portfolio repository helpful in getting to know more about my work and abilities. Thank you for visiting!
